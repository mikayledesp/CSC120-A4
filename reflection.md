- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
At first, I thought that encapsulation was extremely confusing! After attending both 2/20 and 2/21 office hours I understand due to asking Bobbi tons of questions. I didnt seem to understand the benefits of making classes private and wondered why all classes werent all just public. After getting it explained to me I now understand that not all information should be acessed publically! Like if you were a store owner, you wouldnt want customers acessing your sales database!
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Asking Bobbi lots of questions suring office hours really helped. I also watched putside youtube sources that helped reinforce my ideas arround encapsulation. I think not planninf what I was doing before I started didnt help me and foced me to plan out parts of my code in notion beforehand.
